# FriendFinder

The "FriendFinder" application is basically simulating a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

Express will be pivitol in this app for handling routing.

Heroku will be used to allow other user's to be able to use the FriendFinder app
